This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms.


# How to run
`algs4.jar` (also availible [here](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4/)) is a library, provided by the course. You must download and add `algs4.jar` to the CLASSPATH environment variable, or you can compile and execute your program using the -classpath or -cp option, as shown below.


## For Windows:
If you have downloaded the library in, say `C:\Users\username\algs4\algs4.jar`.
```
javac -cp .;C:\Users\username\algs4\algs4.jar HelloWorld.java
java -cp .;C:\Users\username\algs4\algs4.jar HelloWorld
```

## For Linux and Mac OS
Use `:` instead of `;`, then specify full path to the file:
```
javac -cp .:~/algs4/algs4.jar HelloWorld.java
java -cp .:~/algs4/algs4.jar HelloWorld
```
