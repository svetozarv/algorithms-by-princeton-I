This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms.
There are 6 programming assignments in this course.
1. [Hello, World](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/hello/specification.php) (practice, optional)
2. [Percolation](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php)
3. [Queues](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php)
4. [Collinear Points](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear/specification.php)
5. [8 Puzzle](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle/specification.php)
6. [Kd-Trees](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree/specification.php)

# Requirements
`algs4.jar` (also availible [here](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4/)) is a library, provided by the course. You must download and add `algs4.jar` to the CLASSPATH environment variable, or you can compile and execute your program using the -classpath or -cp option.
